# AdBlock Feeds

These are a collection of AdBlock feeds that I've created to have a better
internet experience.

## All

[all.txt](./all.txt)

This is a combination of the other three.

## Never Read The Comments

[never-read-the-comments.txt](./never-read-the-comments.txt)

These rules eliminate comments sections on news sites, blogs, and more. They
also remove the chat bars from several streaming sites.

## Misc

[misc.txt](./misc.txt)

These rules block ads that the normal AdBlock feeds don't, as well as some
modal dialog boxes.

## Social Without Social

[social-without-social.txt](./social-without-social.txt)

This removes the news feed from Facebook, Twitter's main feed from Twitter,
and a few other pieces that I don't like.
